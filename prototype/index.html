            <h2>3D Interface</h2>
            <p>
                This is the prototype of a 3D interface. You can move the
                camera with the arrow keys of your keyboard, and change the
                angle of the camera by dragging and dropping the scene around
                it (you can also use your numpad, 2 to look lower, 8 to look
                higher, 4 to look on the left and 6 to look on the right, but
                if you're more comfortable with non-numpad keys, you can also
                use i for up, j for left, k for down, and l for right).
            </p>
            <p>
                Recommended views are displayed with a transparent red arrow.
                They disappear when you come closer to them, and you can
                automatically move to them by clicking on them. You can reset
                the camera at anytime by clicking on the reset button.
