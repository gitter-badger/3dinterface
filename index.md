  - [A bouncing cube that jumps when you click on it](/bouncing/)

    Jumps and bounce when you click on it :smiley:

  - [Sphere with multi-resolution](/multipshere/)

    Lots of obj files loaded and displayed. When you click
    somewhere, the current obj is hidden and the next one, with a
    better resolution is shown.

  - [A proto of the real thing](/prototype/)

    You can move the camera with the arrow keys and move the angle of the camera
    with 2, 4, 6 and 8 (the arrows of the numpad), or you can do a drag-and-drop
    like (click on the mouse to grap the scene, and move the mouse to rotate the
    camera). You can also select a camera by clicking on the red part of it, and
    get back to the free camera by clicking again. You can also select a camera by
    simply clicking on the object you want to see. The program will choose the
    camera that you want, and move to it progressively.

  - [Streaming simulation](/stream/)

    A mesh of a sphere is fully loaded,
    and displayed progressively. This test is here to prove that we can dynamically
    add vertices and faces to a mesh.
