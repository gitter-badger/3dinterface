        <ul>
            <li><a href="/bouncing/">A bouncing cube that jumps when you click on it</a></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a href="/multisphere/">Sphere with multi-resolution</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lots of obj files loaded and displayed. When you click
                    somewhere, the current obj is hidden and the next one, with
                    a better resolution is shown.
                </p>

                    You can move the camera with the arrow keys and move the
                    angle of the camera with 2, 4, 6 and 8 (the arrows of the
                    numpad), or you can do a drag-and-drop like (click on the
                    mouse to grap the scene, and move the mouse to rotate the
                    camera). You can also select a camera by clicking on the
                    red part of it, and get back to the free camera by clicking
                    again. You can also select a camera by simply clicking on
                    the object you want to see. The program will choose the
                    camera that you want, and move to it progressively.

                    A mesh of a sphere is fully loaded, and displayed
                    progressively. This test is here to prove that we can
                    dynamically add vertices and faces to a mesh.
