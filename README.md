# 3D Interface
This is the beginning of the typescript version of 3D interface : a prototype
for a user-friendly 3D interface allowing to browse 3D scenes / models written
with Node.js.

It is hosted by [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) at
[3dinterface.no-ip.org](http://3dinterface.no-ip.org).

Compiling is not stable yet... come back later !
