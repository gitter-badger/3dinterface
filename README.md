# 3D Interface
A prototype for a user-friendly 3D interface allowing to browse 3D scenes / models written with Node.js.

It is hosted by [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) at [3dinterface.no-ip.org](http://3dinterface.no-ip.org).

## To run a local server
As usual with NodeJS, it's quite easy to test. Just ensure you have `node` installed on your machine, clone this repo somewhere, and then, in the repo do

``` sh
npm install
node server.js
```

You should be able to go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and see the result.
